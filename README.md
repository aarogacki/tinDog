This was made as an exercise based on a challenge in the [AppBrewery Web Development Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gGAksZcV9URng=/). I developed this website using the skeleton and images that they provided. I developed each piece by looking at the final product and working on my project to look as much as their version as possible.

I also challenged myself, just for funsies, to add a CircleCI job to lint the CSS.
